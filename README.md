## Metric Formulas

### Fund-Level Metrics
1. **TVPI** = (Distributed + Unrealized) / Paid-In Capital
2. **DPI** = Distributed Capital / Paid-In Capital
3. **RVPI** = Unrealized Value / Paid-In Capital
4. **IRR** = ((Total Value / Paid-In) ^ (1 / Fund Age)) - 1
5. **MOIC** = Total Value / Total Invested
6. **Capital Called** = Paid-In Capital / Fund Size
7. **Deployment Rate** = Total Invested / Paid-In Capital
8. **Cash Yield** = Distributed Capital / Paid-In Capital
9. **Fund Age** = Current Year - Vintage Year
10. **Net Asset Value** = Unrealized Value

### Deal-Level Metrics
11. **Average Check Size** = Total Investments / Number of Companies
12. **Ownership %** = Average Ownership across portfolio
13. **Markup Ratio** = Unrealized Value / Cost Basis
14. **Follow-On Rate** = Follow-On Investments / Total Companies
15. **Entry Valuation** = Investment Size / Ownership %

### Portfolio-Level Metrics
16. **Loss Ratio** = Write-offs / Total Companies
17. **Exit Rate** = Exits / Total Companies
18. **Concentration** = Top 5 Holdings Value / Total Value
19. **Success Rate** = (Total Companies - Write-offs) / Total Companies
20. **Portfolio Size** = Number of Companies

## Benchmark Ranges

| Metric | Excellent | Good | Poor |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| TVPI | 3.0x+ | 2.0-3.0x | <2.0x |
| DPI | 2.5x+ | 1.5-2.5x | <1.5x |
| IRR | 30%+ | 20-30% | <20% |
| Loss Ratio | <30% | 30-50% | >50% |
| Exit Rate | 40%+ | 25-40% | <25% |
